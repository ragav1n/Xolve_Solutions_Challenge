# 🌍 Solutions Challenge

This project is built as part of the **Google Developer Student Clubs (GDSC) Solutions Challenge** to create real-world tech solutions aligned with the **UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**.

> 📌 **Project Goal:**  
> _[Brief one-liner about your project purpose — customize this line]_  
> A web application designed to [briefly explain the problem it solves] and contribute to [relevant SDG like “Quality Education”, “Good Health and Well-being”, etc.].

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Vite** – Lightning-fast frontend build tool
- **TypeScript** – Strongly-typed JavaScript
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first CSS framework
- **Supabase** – Backend as a Service (used for database and user authentication)
- **Gemma API (Google Vertex AI)** – Used for intelligent features like AI-driven recommendations, chat, etc.
- **Google IDX** – Cloud-based development environment where this project is developed
- **ESLint** – For linting and maintaining code quality
- **PostCSS** – For processing CSS

---

## 🔐 Authentication & Backend

- **Authentication** is handled using **Supabase Auth** (email/password or OAuth-based).
- **Database** operations (e.g., storing user data, logs, application content) are managed using **Supabase PostgreSQL**.
- All interactions with Supabase are secured and managed through client-side integration using Supabase SDKs.

## 🧠 AI Integration

We leverage **Gemma API**, powered by **Google Vertex AI**, to enable:
- Smart responses / conversational agents
- Personalized recommendations / insights
- Any other AI-driven feature unique to your app
